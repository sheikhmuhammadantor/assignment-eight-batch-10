# React Fundamental concepts :

## 1. **Components**
   - **Function Components**: Used to create reusable UI Components, such as `Navbar`, `ProductDetails`, and `Cart`.
   - **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs by combining smaller components.

## 2. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**
   - Syntax for combining HTML with JavaScript within components for rendering elements.
   - Used to create and structure page layouts within React components.

## 3. **Props (Properties)**
   - Passing data between components, such as sending product details from `ProductList` to individual `ProductCard` components.

## 4. **State Management**
   - **useState**: Managing dynamic data within components, like toggle states for the wishlist and cart actions.
   - State is also used to handle user interactions, such as button clicks for "Add to Cart" or "Add to Wishlist."

## 5. **Lifecycle Methods (via Hooks)**
   - **useEffect**: Handling side effects, such as fetching data from an API, and re-running code when dependencies change.

## 6. **Context API**
   - Provides global access to cart and wishlist functions, enhancing scalability and ease of state management.

## 7. **Conditional Rendering**
   - Rendering elements based on certain conditions, such as showing a "Sold Out" label if a product is unavailable.

## 8. **Lists and Keys**
   - Mapping through arrays of product data to render lists of items with unique keys, such as displaying product categories or wishlist items.

## 9. **Event Handling**
   - Handling user interactions like clicks, and filtering etc.

## 10. **React Router**
   - Navigating between pages within the app, such as moving from the homepage to the product details page or the cart.
   - Using `useNavigate` and `<Link>` for smooth routing.
